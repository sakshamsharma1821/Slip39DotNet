## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our SLIP-0039 implementation seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report security issues by:

1. **Email**: Send details to slip39_security@supere.simplelogin.com
2. **Private disclosure**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Encrypted communication**: Use our PGP key if available

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential security impact and affected components
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: .NET version, operating system, and other relevant details
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or examples demonstrating the vulnerability (if applicable)

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to the following timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Confirmation**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Within 30 days (depending on complexity)
- **Release**: As soon as possible after fix is ready

### Security Update Process

1. **Assessment**: We evaluate the reported vulnerability
2. **Confirmation**: We confirm the issue and determine impact
3. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a security fix
4. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We work with the reporter on disclosure timing
5. **Release**: We release a security update
6. **Advisory**: We publish a security advisory with details

## Security Considerations

### Cryptographic Implementation

This project implements SLIP-0039 Shamir's Secret Sharing, which involves handling sensitive cryptographic material. Key security aspects:

#### What We Do
- ✅ **Specification Compliance**: Implement SLIP-0039 exactly as specified
- ✅ **Standard Libraries**: Use proven .NET cryptographic libraries
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Rigorous validation of all inputs
- ✅ **Memory Safety**: Secure handling of sensitive data
- ✅ **Test Vector Compliance**: Pass all official test vectors

#### What We Don't Do
- ❌ **Custom Crypto**: No custom cryptographic primitives
- ❌ **Key Storage**: We don't store or manage private keys
- ❌ **Network Communication**: No network operations
- ❌ **Side-Channel Protection**: Basic implementation (not hardened against timing attacks)

### Security Best Practices

When using this library:

#### For Developers
```csharp
// ✅ Good: Clear sensitive data
var secret = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(sensitiveData);
try 
{
    var shares = Slip39ShareGeneration.GenerateShares(secret, 2, 3);
    // Use shares...
}
finally 
{
    Array.Clear(secret, 0, secret.Length); // Clear sensitive data
}

// ❌ Bad: Leaving secrets in memory
var shares = Slip39ShareGeneration.GenerateShares(
    Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(sensitiveData), 2, 3);
```

#### For Users
- **Secure Storage**: Store mnemonic shares securely and separately
- **Backup Strategy**: Have a proper backup strategy for your shares
- **Threshold Security**: Understand that you need the threshold number of shares
- **Passphrase Security**: Use strong, memorable passphrases when applicable
- **Environment Security**: Use the tool in a secure environment

### Known Limitations

#### Security Limitations
- **Side-Channel Attacks**: Not hardened against timing or power analysis attacks
- **Memory Dumps**: Sensitive data may persist in memory dumps
- **Multi-Threading**: Not designed for concurrent access to sensitive operations
- **Platform Security**: Relies on underlying platform security

#### Recommended Use Cases
- ✅ **Development and Testing**: Safe for development and testing
- ✅ **Educational Purposes**: Good for learning SLIP-0039
- ✅ **Non-Critical Applications**: Suitable for non-critical secret sharing
- ⚠️ **Production Use**: Review security requirements carefully
- ❌ **High-Security Environments**: May not meet stringent security requirements

### Threat Model

#### In Scope
- **Implementation Bugs**: Errors in cryptographic implementation
- **Input Validation**: Improper handling of malicious inputs
- **Memory Safety**: Sensitive data handling issues
- **API Misuse**: Insecure usage patterns

#### Out of Scope
- **Physical Attacks**: Hardware-based attacks on the device
- **Social Engineering**: Attacks targeting users directly
- **Operating System**: Vulnerabilities in the underlying OS
- **Network Security**: Network-based attacks (not applicable)

### Security Auditing

#### Current Status
- ✅ **Code Review**: Internal code review completed
- ✅ **Test Vector Validation**: All official test vectors pass
- ✅ **Static Analysis**: Basic static analysis performed
- ❌ **External Audit**: No external security audit performed
- ❌ **Formal Verification**: No formal verification performed

#### Future Plans
- Consider external security audit for future versions
- Implement additional security hardening measures
- Add more comprehensive security testing

### Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and will:

- **Acknowledge**: Acknowledge valid security reports promptly
- **Communicate**: Keep reporters informed of progress
- **Credit**: Provide appropriate credit for valid reports (if desired)
- **Timeline**: Work towards reasonable disclosure timelines
- **Coordination**: Coordinate with reporters on public disclosure
