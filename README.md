## Overview

Slip39DotNet is a comprehensive .NET implementation of SLIP-0039, which is Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme with BIP32 support. This library allows developers to manage sensitive data securely by splitting secrets into shares, which can be distributed among different parties. The implementation is straightforward, efficient, and designed to work seamlessly within .NET applications.

## Features

- **SLIP-0039 Support**: Full support for Shamir's Secret Sharing.
- **BIP32 Compatibility**: Integration with BIP32 for hierarchical deterministic wallets.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API for quick integration into your projects.
- **C# Language**: Written in C#, making it easy for .NET developers to adopt.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides and examples to help you get started.
- **Unit Tests**: Thorough testing to ensure reliability and correctness.

## Installation

To install Slip39DotNet, you can use NuGet Package Manager. Run the following command in your Package Manager Console:

```bash
Install-Package Slip39DotNet
```

Alternatively, you can add it via the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package Slip39DotNet
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example to demonstrate how to use Slip39DotNet:

```csharp
using Slip39DotNet;

// Create a new secret
var secret = new Secret("Your super secret data");

// Split the secret into shares
var shares = secret.Split(3, 2); // 3 total shares, 2 required to reconstruct

// Combine shares to recover the secret
var recoveredSecret = Secret.Combine(shares.Take(2));
Console.WriteLine(recoveredSecret.Data);
```

This example shows how to create a secret, split it into shares, and then recover it using a subset of those shares.
